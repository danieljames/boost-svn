Hello there,

I'm using this fork to backport fixes for Boost.Unordered and
Boost.Functional/Hash. Fixes are in the branches `fixes_1_xx_x`, where
`1_xx_x` is the appropriate version number. So, fixes for Boost 1.49.0
are in `fixes_1_49_0`. Most of these branches are entirely untested, so
you should run the tests with your favoured setup.

Since the main purpose of these branches is to maintain patches, it's
quite likely that I'll rebase them, or do something equally dodgy.
